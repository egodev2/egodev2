### Diego Martos - @egodev2 👋

Hey, I'm Diego, a graduate student at Universidade Federal do ABC, and my research is focused in software engineering and the development/use of serious games. I love playing Final Fantasy XIV + The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time :space_invader:, and mess around with video/sound edition.

## Quick facts

- 🔭 I'm pursuing a master's degree at Universidade Federal do ABC.
- :books: I’m currently learning about video/sound editing and model-driven development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other game creators.
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Stay healthy and learn more about tech-leadership of video game development.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play retro games competitively.
